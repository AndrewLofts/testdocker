# This file is to test calling a  docker builder


#1. Ensure Singularity is installed and loaded
if ! which singularity; then module load singularity; fi


#2. Pull the Oppni Docker File
#3. Build the Oppni Docker File
singularity build doppni.img docker://andrewlofts/testdockerfile


#4. Sets up mount to docker and move files in and out
singularity --bind /path/with/write:/run doppni.img

scp [FILE_LOCATION] mounted/location


#5. Tells the docker to execute the OPPNI Pipeline
singularity exec doppni.img python [OPPNI_LOCATION] -i [INPUT_FILE] -c [PIPELINE_FILE] [OTHER FLAGS]

# OPPNI EXECUTES...

#6. Tells the docker to execute the OPPNI--status to check job completeion
singularity exec doppni.img [OPPNI_LOCATION] -s [FILE_LOCATION]

#7. Aquires the OPPNI status log file and indicates to CBRAIN that the job is complete
